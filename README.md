# You Don't Know JS

Book repository source code for _You Don't Know JS_ by Kyle Simpson.

Code is organized according to book volumes. Each volume has their own workspace and Webpack environment. Javascript files are organized according to their chapter numbers in a single file which exposes a _chapter function_ which will then executed on the main Javascript file. The code, function, and further module structure are then written according to each chapter needs.

Code is run on browser using Webpack as the module bundler. There is no markup other than a simple header indicating a title and placeholder stylesheet using Bootstrap to override the defaults. The focus is the JavaScript code. Therefore, run the code using Webpack Dev Server (or any dev live server of your choosing) and open up your browser's developer tools.
